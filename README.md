# Laptop-Peltier-Cooler
My attempt at cooling the intake air for my laptop to be below ambient temps, in order to not overheat the components while gaming. It will have limits related to ambient air temp and the dew point so that I don't introduce moisture to the laptop internals.

Uses an arduino-style microcontroller.
