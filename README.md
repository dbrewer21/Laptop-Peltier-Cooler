# Laptop-Peltier-Cooler
My attempt at cooling the intake air for my laptop to be below ambient temps, in order to not overheat the components while gaming. It will have limits related to ambient air temp and the dew point so that I don't introduce moisture to the laptop internals.

Uses an arduino-style microcontroller. I'm using the Seeeduino XIAO controller.

I have two code files in this repo. 
   One is my own work. 
   The other is collaboration with Claude (ai) in order to make error handling improvements mostly. And possibly for refactoring my code layout.
